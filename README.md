# TODO-App
This is a TO-DO list app created using Taberis.js to create a cross platform mobile application and 
uses express for Node.js to handle backend.

This project is a good example of TypeScript, Taberis.js, and Express with Node.js

This project contains many unused .ts files, I keep them around as a reference from my first
experiments on how Taberis.js works. There is an example of nearly every Taberis.js widget

The MainPage.ts file is actually the exact same app except everything is store and tracked
locally. This was the first iteration of the app which was eventually changed to the 
current page SyncPage.ts

To run with the local reminder tracking in App.ts create a new MainPage instead of SyncPage
and uncomment the specificied lines in Reminder.ts
